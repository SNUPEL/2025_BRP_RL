## Project Introduction
We develop a block transportation scheduling algorithm for shipyards 
<br>
The Block Transportation Scheduling Problem (BTSP) is a key logistics challenge in shipyards. <br>
Our goal is to develop a **scalable scheduling algorithm capable of dynamic decision-making**. <br>

## Main Function

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Overall framework

<br>

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Markov decision process

#### 2.1 State
- State composed of unscheduled blocks and transporters
    - **edge attributed graph**: compact and effective representation of block transportation statue
        - nodes representing location which contain current transporter information
        - edges representing blocks with origin and destination by disjunctive edge
    - **Crystal graph convolutional neural network**: graph neural network that suitable for encoding edge attributed graph

#### 2.2 Action
- a combination of the vessel and quay-wall (machine assignment and job sequencing)
    - **candidate vessels**
        - newly launched vessels from the docks
        - vessels returning from sea trials
        - vessels waiting at sea owing to the shortage of quay-walls
        - vessels that need to be reallocated due to interruption
    - **candidate quay walls**
        - empty quay walls
        - occupied quay walls with preemption allowed

#### 2.3 Reward
- minimization of the total cost in the post-stage outfitting process
- a sum of three cost-related rewards
    - **penalty cost**: the penalty cost for the delay in the delivery of vessels
    - **moving cost**: the cost of moving the vessels
    - **loss cost**: the additional processing cost

<br>

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ DES-based learning environment
- DES model of the post-stage outfitting process in shipyards
- state transition that takes the action of the agent as the input and calculates the next state and reward.

<br>

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Scheduling agent with PPO algorithm
#### 4.1 Network Structure

- **Representation module**
    - Two types of latent representation are extracted from the heterogeneous graphs and auxiliary matrix, respectively
    - For heterogeneous graphs, the embedding vectors of nodes are generated using the relational information between nodes
    - For an auxiliary matrix, the embedding vectors for combinations of quay-walls and vessels are generated using the MLP layers 
- **Aggregation module**
    - Input vectors for the output model are generated based on the embedding vectors from the representation module
- **Output module**
    - The actor layers calculate the probability distribution over actions $\pi_{\theta} (\cdot|s_t)$
    - The critic layers calculate a approximate state-value function $V_{\pi_{\theta}} (s_t)$, respectively

#### 4.2 Reinforcement Learning Algorithm
- **PPO(proximal policy optimization)**
    - Policy-based reinforcement learning algorithm
